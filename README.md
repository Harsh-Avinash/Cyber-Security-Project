# DNS Tunneling (Attack and Protection)

A firewall can help protect your computer and data by managing your network traffic. 
It does this by blocking unsolicited and unwanted incoming network traffic. A firewall validates access by assessing this incoming traffic for anything malicious like hackers and malware that could infect your computer.

## IMPORTANCE OF IDEA
> Our computer are machines that are incpable of being used as a standalone system hence has become a creature comfort of being always connected to the internet at all times

> If the connection to the internet not only allows us to do better and more things but also impacts our performance by makint th esytem at play vulnerable than the entire idea of the project is lost in the grand scheme of things

> Hence our project aims to setup a simple DNS verification filtering and suspeciosus connection request handler that makes us safer on the internet

> The objective of the paper is to fight dns tunnelling through suggestions.

## Problem Statement and objective

To Bypass Firewalls with DNS Tunnelling which includes Defence Evasion, Exfiltration and Command & Control (Making , Analysing, Bypassing and Protecting a Firewall).
